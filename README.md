 
#**Trivolous** - Insider Trivia  
Its a casual online social game where players make personalized trivia for each other.   Its a fully functional web site and was hosted for over a year.  It was designed using Java Spring 3.x and Hibernate.  Below is information from the help/faq page:

##Game Overview
**Host** - Starts the game by inviting Players and making the first question. Also decides how many questions each player will make.
**Asker** - The person making the question in each round.   The Host is always the first Asker.
**Players** - Everyone answering the question.
**Notices** - An email or message sent via Facebook that tells you what to do next.
**Round** - A Round is complete when every Player has answered the current question.
**Cycle** - A Cycle is complete when all Players have taken a turn as the Asker and created a question.

##Getting Started
* YOU'RE THE HOST!
Create a game by inviting other Players on Trivolous.com or
	via Facebook&rsquo;s Trivolous app, and make the first question. All
	Players will get a Notice.
* YOU&rsquo;RE INVITED!
As soon as you accept, you will get to place your bet (see
	scoring below) and answer the question. All invited Playershave to
	accept, decline, or be removed by the Host for the game to keep
	going. Notices are sent to players who haven't responded.
HOST! You might want to send a personal message if people
	aren&rsquo;t responding!
* YOU'VE ANSWERED!
Wait until everyone has answered. After all Players have
	answered, a Notice is sent with everyone's scores.
* NEXT ROUND!
The next Player in the list becomes the new Asker and makes
	the next question.
* WE'VE ALL MADE A QUESTION!
A new Cycle starts and questions keep being asked and answered
	until all the Cycles are done.
* WE'RE DONE!
A Notice is sent with the final scores! Posturing and shaming
	are optional :)
* FIRST TIME PLAYERS!
Now that you&rsquo;ve played a game you can be the HOST for a
	new game! Think of a fun topic, invite some Players(new and/or
	existing players) and continue the fun!



##Scoring Points
The scoring is designed to reward making good questions that
other players can answer and answering correctly. The Player with
the highest score at the end wins. Before you answer a question you 
will be asked to bet 5, 10 or 25 points
* YOU GOT IT RIGHT!
You win the points you bet.  If you answered the quickest, and you were not the only one to get it right, you get a 5 point bonus.
* YOU GOT IT WRONG BUT OTHER PLAYERS GOT IT RIGHT!
You lose your bet to the Asker
* NO ONE GOT IT RIGHT!
Players win their bets even though they got it wrong. 
ASKER -	you do not want this to happen since other players will gain points
	and you will not!
* EVERYONE GAVE UP!
All Players win their bets.  
ASKER - your fellow players rejected your question. You do not want this to happen since
	everyone else will gain points except you!



							
##Game Tips
###How Do I Win? Here Are Some Tips!
				
* YOU'RE THE ASKER!
You will get the highest score by making questions that are
	hard enough that some people get them wrong, but not SO hard that NO
	ONE gets it right. The optimal score is achieved when one player
	gets it right and all others get it wrong.
* YOU'RE A PLAYER!
You want to make an educated guess since you want to add to
	your points. You don't lose points if you get it wrong, and you will
	win points if no one gets it right. If you are neck and neck with
	the Asker you may not wish to randomly guess on their question as if
	you are wrong you could give them points and put them ahead of you.
	But if the Asker is far ahead or behind you it might be worth a
	guess.


					
						
# FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions
							
###How do I start my own game with my friends?
After you've been invited to and play another game you will be
	able to start your own as the host. 
###I don't see any emails from Trivolous!
First check your spam/junk email folder. Whether it's
there or not, most email providers will allow you to mark certain
email addresses as safe. Go in to your account settings and add
notifier@trivolous.com to your safe emails. However, don't email
notifier@trivolous.com as it does not accept emails.
###How do I keep the game moving?
Daily email reminders are sent to players who need to take
their turn, but sometimes a game can stall. Comments can also be
used to nudge players along. If the player is unavailable for some
period, the game can be paused and then reactivated. If the player
can no longer participate in the game, he may quit, or the host can
remove them.
###I'm stuck and can't think of a good question!
* Troll the internet and wikipedia for ideas.
* Your facebook stream, Pinterest, and Instagram can also be good sources of inspiration.
* Try asking a question about yourself
* Try making a question using an image
* Try creating a true/false question
* Don't worry that your question isn't good, you will find they are always much better than you think.
								
###What if a question was created with an incorrect or disputed answer?
This is possible, even by mistake. It's a social game so send a message and discuss it. There is no advantage to having incorrect answers since no points are given for a question that no one answers
correctly.
###I'm trying to sign in on a computer that I share with another player and I am having trouble!
In the top right corner is a tab with the player's name on it.  Click on that and then click on sign out. If you sign in via Facebook, even on the Trivolous.com website, you need to make sure that the other player is ALSO signed out of Facebook, even if they don't have Facebook open. Then you can sign in as yourself.
###How do I quit?
There is a quit button in the game menu. If you are stuck making a question please take a look at the advice above. If there are other issues you may want to check with the Host for help.
###What's with the name?
It's a combination of 'trivia' and 'frivolous', like the game.
###Is Internet Explorer 8 (IE8) supported?
Sorry it is not.  Trivolous was built using modern web technologies which are not supported by IE8.  IE8 is going end of life in 2015 so we decided not to go too far out of our way to support it.  If possible upgrade your browser as you are missing out on other great websites too.
