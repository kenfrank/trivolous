				<h1>How it works</h1>
				<hr>
				<p>A simple diagram here showing CREATE->(MAKE->ANSWER->SCORE) would be good.</p>
				<p><b>CREATE</b> - The host creates the game by picking a theme and
					inviting a group of players. Here are some example themes:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>"Class of '87" -- played with your high school or college friends.</li>
					<li>"The Smith Family" -- about your own family leading	up to a reunion.</li>
					<li>"The Gators Summer 2013 Season" -- reminisce over the last season with your team mates.</li>
				</ul>
				<p><b>MAKE</b> - One player ('the author') makes a multiple choice
					question that some players should know and may challenge others.
					Pictures can be included.</p>
				<p><b>ANSWER</b> - The other players answer the question in a timed session. 
					Players are notified (by email for example) when it is
					time to take their turn, and can play at their leisure.</p>
				<p><b>SCORE</b> - After all players have answered the score is calculated.
					The scoring is designed to reward players for answering correctly, and punish 
					authors if they make a question that no one could answer.</p>
				<p><b>REPEAT</b> - The game goes through the cycle of
					make->answer->score until each player has a turn at being the
					author one time (or more for longer games).
